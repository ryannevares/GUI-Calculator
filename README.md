# GUI-Calculator
My first project using a GUI and Python3 to make a simple calculator

Version 1.0

Python Version 3.5

Dependencies: Tkinter (for handling GUI)

To run, open command line and then type "python3" followed by the name of the .py file

This is my first app using a graphical interface. The GUI was made using Tkinter. 

Please report any bugs or suggestions to ryannevares@gmail.com
